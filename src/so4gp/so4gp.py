SO4GP
------

    **SO4GP** stands for: "Some Optimizations for Gradual Patterns". SO4GP applies optimizations such as swarm
    intelligence, HDF5 chunks, SVD and many others in order to improve the efficiency of extracting gradual patterns
    (GPs). A GP is a set of gradual items (GI) and its quality is measured by its computed support value. A GI is a pair
    (i,v) where i is a column and v is a variation symbol: increasing/decreasing. Each column of a data set yields 2
    GIs; for example, column age yields GI age+ or age-. For example given a data set with 3 columns (age, salary, cars)
    and 10 objects. A GP may take the form: {age+, salary-} with a support of 0.8. This implies that 8 out of 10 objects
    have the values of column age 'increasing' and column 'salary' decreasing.

    The classical approach for mining GPs is computationally expensive. This package provides Python algorithm
    implementations of several optimization techniques that are applied to the classical approach in order to improve
    its computational efficiency. The algorithm implementations include:
        * (Classical) GRAANK algorithm for extracting GPs
        * Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs
        * Genetic Algorithm for extracting GPs
        * Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs
        * Random Search algorithm for extracting GPs
        * Local Search algorithm for extracting GPs

    Apart from swarm-based optimization techniques, this package also provides a Python algorithm implementation of a
    clustering approach for mining GPs.

    Extract gradual patterns (GPs) from a numeric data source using the Ant Colony Optimization approach
    (proposed in a published paper by Dickson Owuor). A GP is a set of gradual items (GI) and its quality is

    have the values of column age 'increasing' and column 'salary' decreasing.

        In this approach, it is assumed that every column can be converted into gradual item (GI). If the GI is valid
        (i.e. its computed support is greater than the minimum support threshold) then it is either increasing or
        decreasing (+ or -), otherwise it is irrelevant (x). Therefore, a pheromone matrix is built using the number of
        columns and the possible variations (increasing, decreasing, irrelevant) or (+, -, x). The algorithm starts by
        randomly generating GP candidates using the pheromone matrix, each candidate is validated by confirming that
        its computed support is greater or equal to the minimum support threshold. The valid GPs are used to update the
        pheromone levels and better candidates are generated.

    used by algorithms to extract GPs.
